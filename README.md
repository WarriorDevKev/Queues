# Queues

implemented a queue data structure in JavaScript by creating a Queue class that:

• follows FIFO protocol with .enqueue() and .dequeue() methods <br>

• gives the option of creating bounded queues with a .maxSize property <br>

• prevents queue overflow and underflow by keeping track of the queue size
